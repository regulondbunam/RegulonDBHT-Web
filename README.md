# Installation

**Step 1 download project**
You need to download this repository, in its master branch,

    $ git clone https://github.com/regulondbunam/RegulonDBHT-Web.git
    
  You can also download the zip file from the repository and unzip it to a designated location

**Step 2 install dependencies**
Enter the project directory and install the required libraries with the following command

    $ npm install

**Step 3 configuration**
At the root of the project, you will find the .env-sample file where you will find the information to declare the environment variables so that the application can connect to the regulonDB web services.

duplicate the .env-sample file and rename it to .env and add the information requested in the .env-sample file.

``` 
#rename this file to '.env' when the fields have been filled
# REACT_APP_WEB_SERVICE_URL = is the url where the web service is located
# REACT_APP_WEB_SERVICE_URL = "url of RegulonDB-HT GraphQL API"
# REACT_APP_PROSSES_SERVICE = "url of RegulonDB - Web Data Process Service"
# REACT_APP_IP = is the public ip address of the domain
# REACT_APP_DOMAIN_NAME = is the name of the web domain

REACT_APP_WEB_SERVICE_URL = ""
REACT_APP_PROSSES_SERVICE = ""
REACT_APP_IP = "0.0.0.0"
REACT_APP_DOMAIN_NAME = ""
```
**Step 4 start service**
 You can find more information on how to implement this application in the following link [cra-deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment)
 
For environments using  [Node](https://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to handle this would be to install  [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve)  and let it handle the rest:
```
npm install -g serveserve -s build
```
Copy
The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port  **3000**. Like many of  [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve)â€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the  `-l`  or  `--listen`  flags:
```
serve -s build -l 4000
```
Copy
Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

```
serve -h
```
